## ðŸ§© Challenge: International Space Station 25th Anniversary Apps

Crews onboard the International Space Station have many unique opportunities! They witness breathtaking Earth views from the station's cupola â€” known as "the window to the world." â€‹â€‹They also experience weightlessness and go outside the station on spacewalks, for which they must train extensively in the Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory (NBL) at the Sonny Carter Training Facility in Houston, Texas. Your challenge is to create a visual tool that not only helps students and the public understand two of the most prominent sensory experiences on the station (sight and weightlessness) through the lens of the cupola and the NBL, but also informs them how these unique experiences benefit humans on Earth.

## ðŸ”¦ Our Solution

### Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory

As our solution we present a game that is continuing development of our last year's submission **Microgravity Situation**, adding a new game mode: **Buoyancy Situation**!

**Buoyancy Situation** is a game where you get to experience for yourself the reason why all astronauts practice at **Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory** before they go into space, where they can take a picture peering through the windows of **Cupola** module.

In this game you are an astronaut with the objective to get from one end of the station to another by propelling yourself with a pingpong gun in 0 gravity. Learn how to go in a desired direction, learn how to maneuver and claim the coveted "Smooth navigator"-fastest time!

### Cupola

As we had a two part challenge, we also decided to address the **Cupola** challenge by going through the history of the cupola, and compiling a storyline highlighting moments when ISS crew utilized the **Cupola** module to reach out to astronauts below. This is showcased on the created website, which includes a link to go play the game. My main contributions in the project were website design and all-around help to other team members.
